Welcome and Thanks for Visiting!
======
Hi, I'm Ahmad Talafha. I'm delighted you're here to explore my work in statistics. On this site, you'll find my research, publications, and a bit about my academic journey. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out. Enjoy exploring!

Bio
======
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Bowling Green State University, under the guidance of [Dr. John Chen](https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/mathematics-and-statistics/faculty-and-staff/john-chen.html). My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan, followed by two master's degrees - one in Mathematics from Southeast Missouri State University, where I delved into the econometric approach to European Option Valuation, and another in Statistics from Western Michigan University.

Research Interests
======

My research interests are diverse yet focused, spanning functional data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, statistical learning, biostatistics, and statistical and econometric modeling. These areas represent my quest to explore and solve complex data-driven problems in various contexts.
