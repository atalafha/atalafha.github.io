Welcome and Thanks for Visiting!
======
Hi, I'm Ahmad Talafha. I'm delighted you're here to explore my work in statistics. On this site, you'll find my research, publications, and a bit about my academic journey. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out. Enjoy exploring!

Bio
======
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Bowling Green State University, under the guidance of Dr. John Chen. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan, followed by two master's degrees - one in Mathematics from Southeast Missouri State University, where I delved into the econometric approach to European Option Valuation, and another in Statistics from Western Michigan University.

Research Interests
======

My research interests are diverse yet focused, spanning functional data analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, statistical learning, biostatistics, and statistical and econometric modeling. These areas represent my quest to explore and solve complex data-driven problems in various contexts.



Publications
======

My contributions to the field are highlighted in several peer-reviewed journal articles. Notably, my work with Emmanuel Thompson on "Regularization-Based Bootstrap Ranking Model: Identifying Healthcare Indicators Among All Level Income Economies" published in the African Journal of Applied Statistics reflects my keen interest in applying statistical models to real-world issues. Additionally, I co-authored papers in TechTrends and the Journal of Statistical and Econometric Methods, focusing on training transfer, attitudes towards training, and economic activity forecasting.

Academic and Professional Aspirations
======

As I progress towards completing my Ph.D., I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and expertise. My goal is not just to excel academically but to contribute meaningfully to the statistical community and beyond. I am open to collaborations, discussions, and inquiries in my field, and look forward to opportunities that challenge and grow my understanding of statistics and its applications.
